Before screening, the dimer product was synthesed in-lab. The NMR spectra was taken from this product and the LC-MS spectra was taken from the screening products. 
Yield:
The assignment of peaks in the report was actually less accurate because it was based on the 1st spectrum in the 'word document', which is less pure than the 2nd one. The peaks at the 2nd one are more accurate.
Recent discovery of our group suggested a new molecular structure of the dimer product, so the structures shown at the dissertation were different from Kok's. 
I would like to thank my colleague, Miss Susie Petri, for the calibration curve calculation.
